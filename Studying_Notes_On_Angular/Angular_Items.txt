src/app/:
The initial page is the application shell which is controlled by the angular component called AppComponent. The files inside the app folder are the AppComponent files.
In order to display custom components we need to add their selector tag in the application shell AppComponent.

src/styles.css:
This is a global stylesheet document. If the entire app needs to be under specific styles, this is where the base styles need to be.
