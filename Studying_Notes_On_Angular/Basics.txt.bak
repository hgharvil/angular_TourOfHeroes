In order to install angular we use:
npm install -g @angular/cli

In order to create a workspace and initial application we use:
ng new my-app
(we would then proceed to choose features in the terminal menu before the new project is generated)

In ordere to run the project we use:
cd my-app
ng serve --open
(or ng serve -o)
This will have the browser open the url "http://localhost:4200/"
